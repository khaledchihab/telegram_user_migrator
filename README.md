     1. Log in with your phone number
     2. Click on "API Development Tools"
     3. Fill in the form (any name will do)
     4. Save your `API_ID` and `API_HASH`

## Installation üîß

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram_user_migrator.git
   cd telegram_user_migrator
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage üöÄ

### Basic Command Format (Single Account)
```bash
python telegram_user_migrator.py -a API_ID -H API_HASH -s SOURCE_GROUP -t TARGET_GROUP [options]
```

### Multi-Account Command Format
```bash
python telegram_user_migrator.py -m accounts.json -s SOURCE_GROUP -t TARGET_GROUP [options]
```

### Parameters Explained
- `-a` or `--api-id`: Your Telegram API ID (single account mode)
- `-H` or `--api-hash`: Your Telegram API Hash (single account mode)
- `-m` or `--multi-account`: JSON file with multiple account credentials (multi-account mode)
- `-s` or `--source-group`: Source group to copy members from
- `-t` or `--target-group`: Target group to add members to
- `-d` or `--dry-run`: Test the migration without actually moving users
- `-b` or `--batch-size`: Number of users to process per batch (default: 5)
- `-w` or `--wait-time`: Wait time between batches in seconds (default: 30)
- `-l` or `--limit`: Limit number of users to migrate (default: 0, no limit)
- `--filter-bots`: Filter out bots from migration (enabled by default)
- `--session`: Custom session name for single account mode

### Group ID Formats
You can specify groups in several ways:
- Username: `@groupname`
- Private group ID: `-1001234567890` or `-100123456789`
- Basic group ID: `-123456789`

### Examples

1. Migrate from public to private group (single account):
   ```bash
   python telegram_user_migrator.py -a 12345 -H "your_api_hash" -s "@sourcegroup" -t "-100987654321"
   ```

2. Migrate using multiple accounts:
   ```bash
   python telegram_user_migrator.py -m accounts.json -s "@sourcegroup" -t "-100987654321"
   ```

3. Test migration with dry-run:
   ```bash
   python telegram_user_migrator.py -a 12345 -H "your_api_hash" -s "@sourcegroup" -t "-100987654321" -d
   ```

4. Custom batch size and wait time:
   ```bash
   python telegram_user_migrator.py -a 12345 -H "your_api_hash" -s "@sourcegroup" -t "-100987654321" -b 10 -w 15
   ```

## Multi-Account Configuration üîë

To use multiple accounts, create a JSON file (e.g., `accounts.json`) with your account credentials:

```json
[
    {
        "api_id": "12345",
        "api_hash": "your_first_api_hash",
        "session_name": "account1"
    },
    {
        "api_id": "67890",
        "api_hash": "your_second_api_hash",
        "session_name": "account2"
    }
]
```

- Each account should have `api_id` and `api_hash`
- `session_name` is optional and will be auto-generated if not provided
- Using multiple accounts can make migration significantly faster
- The tool will automatically distribute users among available accounts
- If one account gets rate-limited, the tool will use another account

See `accounts.json.example` for a sample configuration.

## Finding Group IDs üîç

1. **For Public Groups**: Just use the username with @ (e.g., @groupname)

2. **For Private Groups**:
   - Forward any message from the group to @username_to_id_bot
   - Or use the group's invite link - the numbers after the '/' are part of the ID

## Common Issues & Solutions üîß

1. **"Peer ID Invalid" Error**
   - Double-check the group ID format
   - Make sure you're a member of both groups
   - Verify that the bot/user has admin rights in the target group

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - The script automatically handles rate limits by waiting
   - Using multi-account mode can help bypass rate limiting issues
   - Don't worry if you see "Waiting X seconds" messages

3. **Privacy Restrictions**
   - Some users can't be added due to their privacy settings
   - This is normal and the script will skip these users

## Migration Reports üìä

After each run, the script generates detailed reports in:
- `migration_reports/report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` (machine-readable)
- `migration_reports/report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` (human-readable)

For multi-account migrations, reports include additional statistics:
- Per-account success rates
- Overall performance metrics
- Account distribution data

## Safety Tips üõ°Ô∏è

1. Always run with `-d` (dry-run) first to test
2. Keep your API credentials private
3. Don't share the session files
4. Respect Telegram's terms of service
5. Don't use for spam or harassment

## Need Help? ‚ùì

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error message in the console
2. Look at the generated report file
3. Verify your permissions in both groups
4. Make sure your API credentials are correct
